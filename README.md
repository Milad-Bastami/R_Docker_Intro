### We will cover the following focus points:
## 1. What is Docker and why should we use it?
## 2. Launching Docker Desktop
## 3. Running Docker via command line
## 4. Pulling from Docker Hub (Rocker)
## 5. Create a Dockerfile and Build a Docker Image



  
    
 # 1. What is Docker and why should we use it?
#### “Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications.” - [link to Docker Getting Started](docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/)  
Docker Provides the following benefits:  
Provides ability to package and run application in a container  
Containers are lightweight (fast)  
Consistent and reproducible  
Self contained  
Responsive deployment and scaling  

### Is using a container the same as using a virtual machine (VM)?

## Container != VMs
#### Docker container PROS:
More lightweight, start much faster, and use a fraction of the memory compared to booting an entire OS  
Applications that are running on containers are completely segregated and isolated from each other  
Have a consistent environment (reproducible) and shareable to outside environments  
Easy to maintain versioning and updates (i.e. CodeCommit/CodePipeline in AWS)  

## Breakdown of basic Docker Architecture and Objects

#### Docker daemon  
The Docker daemon (dockerd) listens for Docker API requests and manages Docker objects such as images, containers, networks, and volumes. A daemon can also communicate with other daemons to manage Docker services.  

#### Docker client
The Docker client is the primary way that many Docker users interact with Docker. When you use commands such as docker run, the client sends these commands to dockerd, which carries them out. The docker command uses the Docker API. The Docker client can communicate with more than one daemon.  

#### Docker registry
Docker registry stores Docker images. Docker Hub is a public registry that anyone can use, and Docker is configured to look for images on Docker Hub by default.   
  
#### Docker image
(Docker Object) An image is a read-only template with instructions for creating a Docker container. Often, an image is based on another image, with some additional customization. For example, you may build an image which is based on the ubuntu image, but installs the Apache web server and your application, as well as the configuration details needed to make your application run.  
  
 #### Docker Container
(Docker Object) A container is a runnable instance of an image. You can create, start, stop, move, or delete a container using the Docker API or CLI. You can connect a container to one or more networks, attach storage to it, or even create a new image based on its current state.
